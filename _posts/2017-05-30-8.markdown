Hey Dad,

How are you today? I talked to Mom yesterday and told her I missed you and she said she misses you, too, and has been thinking about you a lot this week. I'm glad we're at a point where we can talk about you a little bit more freely and not have to hold everything in. It took a few years but better than nothing, right?

She asked me if I cried a lot yet. I said no. I asked her what she has been thinking about and she said she wished you were still here to see Moses and me. And if we had kids one day, she wished you would be here to see them. This made me cry. And then the silence made her ask, "Are you crying right now?" And I shyly responded, "Yeah..." and she said, "It's ok," and I told her that you would be very proud of her. And she said she was doing her best every day to live life to the fullest. And I knew in that moment how proud you were of your strong wife.

I wish you were here, Dad. When I see M's love for grilling, I think about how great you two would get along. Or if you guys would get into battles of who is the better griller. (But let's be real- your Korean BBQ was delicious so it wouldn't have been much of a competition.)

But more so, I miss you in the every day random things. Like when you used to leave me voice messages and check up on me. And tell me it was you even though I knew it was your voice. And then you'd tell me to have a good day.

I even wish you were here and we could watch TV together. I used to think you watched too much sports and Jeopardy but I don't mind that anymore. I'm a better cook these days and I wish I could show you my cooking skills. You'd be so impressed and say how I've stepped up my game from egg sandwiches.
I really wish Mom didn't throw away all the videotapes from our childhood. That could have been great to watch now, huh? Even though I hated it when you video recorded us. But maybe you just knew one day we'd appreciate them.

I have some pretty awesome, friends, Dad. I had a few check up on me today and one of my favorite couples even came by to drop off these off\

So nice, right? Maybe you knew I needed these reminders today to know you aren't very far.

Miss you. Love you more.

Your daughter,


Grace
