M and I have a goal of taking one big trip a year. Early February, we were excited about possibly jumping on the bandwagon and flying to Iceland! The excitement of seeing the Northern Lights and soaking in the Blue Lagoon still bring out butterflies in my stomach! However, in the process of planning, I was thinking if we would see my mom this year or not, and then the idea of meeting my mom in Hawaii came to mind! I shyly bring up the idea to M, not really knowing if he would be on board to spend his one week of vacation with my mom, but he happily replied, "That's a great idea!" That's right, y'all- I married a great one.
So we put plans of Iceland on hold and started looking at tickets to Hawaii. Before we know it, October rolls around and we are not only meeting my mom in Oahu, my brother, D, is meeting us there from San Diego! The four of us spend a whole week together in the beautiful land of Oahu.

Not a bad view, huh?

We definitely took advantage of the shaved ice and poke selection on the island. Sometimes we were eating with one hand and perusing through Yelp with the other, figuring out where we could eat next. When we were at a restaurant, M would order his meal, D would order his own, and when I asked my mom what she wanted to eat, she would automatically reply, "I will share with you and eat whatever you are having." I didn't think too much about this in the beginning because 1. my mom doesn't eat much, 2. she probably doesn't want me eating that much and sharing would help that, and 3. the mother can be quite frugal and paying for an extra meal wouldn't make sense if she couldn't even finish one whole plate by herself. But that always left me with half a meal and half a stomach full. I would say I am normally really great at sharing food but what bothered me the most was mom's assumption we would share everything. M soon noticed her sharing habits and say to me, "Are you OK with your mom sharing your food?" M being fully aware I typically eat more than him and also knowing how hangry I become if my stomach is not full.
And then it hit me hard. I turn to M with the most apologetic eyes and say, "Namj. I am so sorry! I will never ask you to share your food with me ever again!" For all the times we go out and I am being stingy and conscious of my food intake, I always ask him if we could share something or if I could have "just one bite" of what he's ordering. But come on! We all know how this story ends- I end up eating more than "just one bite" and I should have ordered my own plate from the beginning. We would have both been happier. And it clicked- I got it from my mama.
By the end of the trip I told my mom she had to get her own food and it made looking forward to the next meal much more enjoyable. 
Don't worry, I still love her dearly, and I will probably share food with her again the next trip I see her.

Here is a picture of my first and only personal bowl of shaved ice on the island.

It was delicious. 

Here is a picture of the four of us I should probably put in a picture frame one day.
