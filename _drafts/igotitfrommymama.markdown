M and I have a goal of taking one big trip a year. Earlier this year, we were excited about possibly jumping on the bandwagon and flying to Iceland! In the process of planning, I was thinking if we would see my mom this year or not, and then I had the idea of meeting my mom in Hawaii! I shyly brought the idea up to M, not really knowing if he'd be on board to spend his one week of rest with my mom, too, but he happily replied, "That's a great idea!" That's right- I married a good one.
So we put plans of Iceland on hold and started looking at tickets to Hawaii.
