Hi world! I'm sure you haven't noticed but my page was down for a week or two. But thanks to C and his amazing creative skills, it is now up and running with a fresh, new look! Thanks so much, C!! :)

Today is the first day of Fall. I'm convinced everyone is thinking this and I'll write it here: this year has flown by! Nevertheless, I really do enjoy this season- the leaves turn red and orange, the hills in Fremont turn lime green, and the air feels brisk on my cheeks and in my lungs. I also get to eat persimmons and pomegranates very soon. And bake yams and eat all the pumpkin cookies and pies.
